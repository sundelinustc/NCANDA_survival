# NCANDA_survival
Cortical thickness changes dramatically during development and is related to adolescent drinking. We here applied non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), a multivariate data-driven method, to detect 10 structural covariance patterns derived from cortical thickness. We investigated the associations between the probability of developing into heavy and/or moderate drinkers and the NMF patterns in 653 adolescents (12-22 years at baseline) from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) through using the survival analysis approach. We found that lower cortical thickness in 9 out of 10 NMF patterns at baseline was associated with higher risks of developing into moderate or heavy drinkers (q-values < 0.010), and lower cortical thickness in 8 out of 10 NMF patterns at baseline was associated with higher risks of developing into heavy drinkers (q-values < 0.050). We also found that participants with self-identified ethnicity of Caucasian compared to those of African American and other ethnicity were associated with higher risks of developing into moderate or heavy drinkers (q-values < 0.010). Males relative to females were associated with higher risks of developing into heavy drinkers (q-values < 0.010). Older participants were related to higher risks of developing into heavy and/or moderate drinkers (q-values < 0.001). Moreover, adding the baseline age into survival analysis models eliminates the statistical significance of NMF patterns but not that of self-identified race/ethnicity and sex. The findings suggest that cortical thickness at baseline scan, self-identified race/ethnicity, sex, and baseline age could estimate the probability of developing into heavy and/or moderate drinkers in following visits.
